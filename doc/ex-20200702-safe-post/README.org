#+TITLE: Learning Exercise: Post-Money SAFE

* Background

https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/

* How Complex Are SAFEs?

People like to say SAFEs become a hairball after a startup has done more than a few. Is that true? Does the complexity of SAFEs scale linearly, quadratically, or exponentially? Let's find out.

* Conversion

What does the cap table look like at various stages of conversion -- before, during, after?

* Multiple Variants of SAFEs

Four different standard SAFE templates are given. This is good for us, because it gives four points in configuration space, from which we can determine dimensions.

* Answering questions

** How much do I get?

** See the FAQ questions

- can we formalize the questions and the answers?
- can we obtain answers from the questions and the instrument?

* Test Cases

| U | Scenario | Investment Amount | Post Money Valuation Cap | Discount | Option Pool | Series A Raise | Series A Pre-Money Val |
|---+----------+-------------------+--------------------------+----------+-------------+----------------+------------------------|
| 1 | e.g. 1   |            100000 |                     none |        0 |        none |                |                1000000 |
| 2 | II.1     |            200000 |                  4000000 |        0 |           0 |                |                        |
| 3 | II.1     |            800000 |                  8000000 |        0 |        0.10 |        5000000 |               15000000 |


* Learning Objectives
** Sections of Contracts -- Types of Contract Language
*** Parameters
*** Events
*** Definitions
**** Note the evaluation of a Dividend Amount requires quite a lot of calling context.
*** Representations by Party
*** Deontics
called, in the SAFEs, "Miscellaneous"
*** Boilerplate incantations
** Transformators and Combinators
*** Hypotheticals and Counterfactuals
*** Logging Conversions of State Over Time
** Mathematical Formulae
*** constraint solving
(pre-money safes needed to be solved as a system of linear equations)
